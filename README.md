# 📝 Project Documentation
## 📘 Project Overview
This project is a **Strapi application** designed for managing content efficiently. Strapi is a headless CMS built with modern tools and technologies, providing developers with an intuitive admin panel, powerful APIs, and the flexibility to integrate with various deployment platforms.
## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed before starting the project:
- **Node.js**: v18.x to v20.x (as specified in the `engines` field of `package.json`)
- **npm**: v6.x or later
- **Yarn**: (if preferred, to run yarn commands)
- **Docker**: (required for running the application using Docker)

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables may need to be configured for your deployment:

| Variable Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ADMIN_PATH` | Path to the admin panel |
| `STRAPI_ADMIN_BACKEND_URL` | Backend URL for the admin panel |
| `STRAPI_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | Disable telemetry for Strapi (Optional) |
### Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-repo>/project-name.git
cd project-name
```
Install dependencies:
``` bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
### Running the Application
#### Development
To start the application in development mode with **hot-reload** enabled:
``` bash
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```
#### Production
To start the application in production mode:
1. Build the admin panel:
``` bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
```
1. Start the application:
``` bash
   npm run start
   # or
   yarn start
```
### Using Docker
The project comes with Docker support, allowing you to build and run the application inside containers. Modify the `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` file as needed.
To build and run the Docker container:
``` bash
docker build -t strapi-app .
docker run -p 1337:1337 strapi-app
```

## 📦 Dependencies
### Key Dependencies
- **Strapi**: Core CMS framework (`@strapi/strapi: 5.8.1`)
- **Styled-components**: For styling in React (`styled-components: ^6.0.0`)
- **React and React-DOM**: Used for the admin panel (`react: ^18.0.0`)
- **Database Support**: SQLite or others via `better-sqlite3` or `pg`

## ⚙️ Deployment Guidelines
Strapi provides flexibility for deployment to different environments. Follow the official [Deployment Documentation]() for more details. Some options include:
- **Strapi Cloud**: A dedicated platform for deploying Strapi applications.
- **Docker**: Use the provided `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment.
- **Platforms**: Deploy on AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, or VPS.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
### 1. Node.js Version Compatibility
Ensure you're using a Node.js version between **18.x and 20.x**. Running incompatible versions (like 22.x) may cause errors.
### 2. Admin Panel Compilation Errors
If the admin panel build fails:
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed and no conflicts (`npm audit fix`).
- Clear existing artifacts:
``` bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm cache clean --force
  npm install
```
### 3. Docker Issues
If the deployment fails in Docker, ensure:
- The Dockerfile is using the correct Node.js version (e.g., `node:20-alpine3.20`).
- Dependencies are built inside the container.
